I use Kalman Filter to forecast next-day electricity price in France and Belgium, with the exogenous variables being the next-day load forecast and the next-day generation forecast. The France's and Belgium's electricity market are both in the European Power Exchange and intertwined.

The problem formulation of Kalman Filter in the [previous post](https://sherr3h.github.io/2023-01-28-Kalman-Filter-on-Electricity-Prices-and-GPS-Data/).
