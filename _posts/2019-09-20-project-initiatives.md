Check out the comment section of those Youtube gaming videos. What do they say about the giant gaming firms' upcoming financial performances?

Early research on stock market prediction was based on random walk theory and the EfÔ¨Åcient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which assumes that EMH stock market prices are largely driven by new information, i.e. news, rather than present and past prices. Since news is unpredictable, stock market prices will follow a random walk pattern.

Yet the assumptions are often challenged, and that recent research suggests that news may be unpredictable but that very early indicators can be extracted online to predict changes in various economic and commercial indicators. This may conceivably also be the case for the stock market.

A case in point is Battlefield V. See the dislike numbers of this video. Obviously the video game producer mistakenly thought their market, i.e. the gaming community, were still keen on futurist / irrealist games.


**Our initiative is to use the comment section as an alternative data source and perdict gaming firms' financial performance and stock price movements.**
