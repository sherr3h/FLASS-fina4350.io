Check out the comment section of those Youtube gaming videos. What do they say about the giant gaming firms' upcoming financial performances?

See the dislike numbers of this video. Obviously the video game producer mistakenly thought their market, i.e. the gaming community, were still keen on futurist / irrealist games.

In contrast, one good example is Battlefield V.

**Our initiative is to use the comment section as an alternative data source and perdict gaming firms' financial performance and stock price movements.**
